# Morse code cipher

This is a simple web page for generating morse code using mouse clicks with different durations.

The user can simply click on the click area, generating dots and dashes depending on the click duration:
- 0-100ms produces a dot
- 100-500ms produces a dash
- more than 500ms produces a new line (the typed characters are mapped into a letter, if one is found, it is written next to the morse characters, otherwise it is just proceeded to new line)
